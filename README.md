Dropzone Upload and server-side Processing
==========================================

This is a demo project, based on the very good [dropzoneJS](http://www.dropzonejs.com/) project.

The aim is to have a very simple page which can :
* accept drag&drop of files
* upload them to the server
* show server-side processing in real-time, with a nice report output.
 
A live demo is available [HERE](http://gandalf.crocoware.com:9181/)
